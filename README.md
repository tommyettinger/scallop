# scallop
Command-line image scaler, using modified scale2x

## What is it?

This tool scales pixel art images and keeps their existing palettes. It respects transparency, and won't add partial
transparency to an image. It can also scale libGDX .atlas files (which should have images that also need scaling) and
AngelCode BMFont .fnt files (which libGDX uses). This means if a font is inside an atlas texture page, you can resize
all three of the atlas, its image(s), and the font at once.

See [DawnLikeAtlas](https://github.com/tommyettinger/DawnLikeAtlas/tree/master/thirteen) for an example of what this can
do; the atlases there were scaled by an earlier version of this tool.

## Usage (Windows)

Drag and drop images (.png, .jpg, and .jpeg supported), libGDX .atlas files (the current format definitely works, and
the "legacy" format might work), and AngelCode BMFont .fnt files (often generated by other tools, like Hiero or Skin
Composer) onto Scallop.bat , and resized versions will be produced next to the source files. You can also follow the
"any platform" instructions below.

## Usage (Any Platform)

From the command line, run `java -jar Scallop.jar input1 input2...`, where Scallop.jar is in the current directory, Java
is at least version 8 (which should be the oldest version you can easily get these days, and any newer version will work
as well), and the input or inputs can be .png, .jpg, .jpeg, libGDX .atlas, and/or AngelCode BMFont .fnt files. At least
one input is required, but there is no upper limit.
